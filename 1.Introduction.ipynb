We group together the pixels with similar attributes using image segmentation. We can divide or partition the image into various parts called segments. It’s not a great idea to process the entire image at the same time as there will be regions in the image which do not contain any information. By dividing the image into segments, we can make use of the important segments for processing the image. That, in a nutshell, is how image segmentation works.\n","Image below shows difference in object detection and image segmentation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_07Y-sCIsc-U","colab_type":"text"},"source":["![picture](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1f6ZTf-tH6xPj-W7ruyhoqBm4H1NgGbMs)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0l3TeGHox2O0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Object detection builds a bounding box corresponding to each class in the image.

You might have put the pieces together – object detection will not be very useful here.
